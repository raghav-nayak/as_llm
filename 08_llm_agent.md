we can have different LLM for each of these agents.
agents communicate using message streams

LLM Agent(text book definition)
- a system capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals.
- utilizes the language model's capabilities to perform tasks and interact with users or other systems 


perma(permanent) context

in memory, tasks are done in the past.
3 types of memory
- short term memory
- long term memory
- hybrid memory

Planning
- a systematic process by which an LLM analyzes user inquires, gathers relevant information, and strategizes its actions to provide optimal recommendations or solutions
- with agents using context and memory

With agents, we get shallow autonomy
- repetition
- interaction
- artificial supervision
